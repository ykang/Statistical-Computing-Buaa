## Data Frames

- *data frame* is a key data structure in statistics and in R. 
- one observation per row and each column represents a variable
- we need to have good tools for dealing with them. 
- you have seen `subset()` function and the use of `[` and `$` 
- `dplyr` package is designed to mitigate a lot of complex operations for data frames.

## The `dplyr` Package

- by Hadley Wickham of RStudio
- everything `dplyr` does could already be done with base R, but it *greatly* simplifies existing functionality in R. 
- it provides a "grammar" (in particular, verbs) for data manipulation and for operating on data frames. 
- the `dplyr` functions are **very** fast, as many key operations are coded in C++.


## `dplyr` Grammar

Some of the key "verbs" provided by the `dplyr` package are

* `select`: return a subset of the columns of a data frame, using a flexible notation
* `filter`: extract a subset of rows from a data frame based on logical conditions
* `arrange`: reorder rows of a data frame
* `rename`: rename variables in a data frame
* `mutate`: add new variables/columns or transform existing variables
* `summarise` / `summarize`: generate summary statistics of different
  variables in the data frame, possibly within strata
* `%>%`: the "pipe" operator is used to connect multiple verb actions together into a pipeline




## Common `dplyr` Function Properties

All of the functions have a few common characteristics. In particular, 

1. The first argument is a data frame.

2. The subsequent arguments describe what to do with the data frame specified in the first argument, and you can refer to columns in the data frame directly without using the $ operator (just use the column names).

3. The return result of a function is a new data frame.

4. Data frames must be properly formatted and annotated for this to all be useful. In particular, the data must be [tidy](http://www.jstatsoft.org/v59/i10/paper). In short, there should be one observation per row, and each column should represent a feature or characteristic of that observation.


## Installing the `dplyr` package

```{r,eval=FALSE}
install.packages("dplyr")
```


After installing the package it is important that you load it into your R session with the `library()` function.

```{r}
library(dplyr)
```


## `select()`

We will use a dataset containing air pollution and temperature data for the [city of Chicago](http://www.biostat.jhsph.edu/~rpeng/leanpub/rprog/chicago_data.zip) in the U.S.    

```{r}
chicago <- readRDS("chicago.rds")
```


```{r}
dim(chicago)
str(chicago)
```

Sometimes you may want to use only a couple of variables out of many.

```{r}
names(chicago)[1:3]
subset <- select(chicago, city:dptp)
head(subset)
```


Sometimes you may want to drop some variables that are not useful.

```{r,eval=FALSE}
select(chicago, -(city:dptp))
```


If you wanted to keep every variable that ends with a "2", we could do

```{r}
subset <- select(chicago, ends_with("2"))
str(subset)
```

Or if we wanted to keep every variable that starts with a "d", we could do

```{r}
subset <- select(chicago, starts_with("d"))
str(subset)
```



## `filter()`

The `filter()` function is used to extract subsets of rows from a data frame. 


```{r}
chic.f <- filter(chicago, pm25tmean2 > 30)
str(chic.f)
```


```{r}
summary(chic.f$pm25tmean2)
```

We could for example extract the rows where PM2.5 is greater than 30 *and* temperature is greater than 80 degrees Fahrenheit.


```{r}
chic.f <- filter(chicago, pm25tmean2 > 30 & tmpd > 80)
select(chic.f, date, tmpd, pm25tmean2)
```




## `arrange()`

The `arrange()` function is used to reorder rows of a data frame according to one of the variables/columns. 

Here we can order the rows of the data frame by date, so that the first row is the earliest (oldest) observation and the last row is the latest (most recent) observation.

```{r}
chicago <- arrange(chicago, date)
```

We can now check the first few rows

```{r}
head(select(chicago, date, pm25tmean2), 3)
```

and the last few rows.

```{r}
tail(select(chicago, date, pm25tmean2), 3)
```

Columns can be arranged in descending order too by useing the special `desc()` operator.

```{r}
chicago <- arrange(chicago, desc(date))
```

Looking at the first three and last three rows shows the dates in descending order.

```{r}
head(select(chicago, date, pm25tmean2), 3)
tail(select(chicago, date, pm25tmean2), 3)
```
How would you do this in base R without `dplyr`?

## `rename()`

Renaming a variable in a data frame in R is surprisingly hard to do! The `rename()` function is designed to make this process easier.

Here you can see the names of the first five variables in the `chicago` data frame.

```{r}
head(chicago[, 1:5], 3)
```

Now we rename the awkward variable names.

```{r}
chicago <- rename(chicago, dewpoint = dptp, pm25 = pm25tmean2)
head(chicago[, 1:5], 3)
```

 

## `mutate()`

The `mutate()` function exists to compute transformations of variables in a data frame. 

For example, with air pollution data, we often want to *detrend* the data by subtracting the mean from the data. 


```{r}
chicago <- mutate(chicago, pm25detrend = pm25 - mean(pm25, na.rm = TRUE))
head(chicago)
```



## `group_by()`

The `group_by()` function is used to generate summary statistics from the data frame within strata defined by a variable. For example, in this air pollution dataset, you might want to know what the average annual level of PM2.5 is. 

First, we can create a `year` varible using `as.POSIXlt()`.

```{r}
chicago <- mutate(chicago, year = as.POSIXlt(date)$year + 1900)
```

Now we can create a separate data frame that splits the original data frame by year.

```{r}
years <- group_by(chicago, year)
```

Finally, we compute summary statistics for each year in the data frame with the `summarize()` function.

```{r}
summarize(years, pm25 = mean(pm25, na.rm = TRUE), 
          o3 = max(o3tmean2, na.rm = TRUE), 
          no2 = median(no2tmean2, na.rm = TRUE))
```

## `group_by()`

In a slightly more complicated example, we might want to know what are the average levels of ozone (`o3`) and nitrogen dioxide (`no2`) within quintiles of `pm25`. A slicker way to do this would be through a regression model, but we can actually do this quickly with `group_by()` and `summarize()`.

First, we can create a categorical variable of `pm25` divided into quintiles.

```{r}
qq <- quantile(chicago$pm25, seq(0, 1, 0.2), na.rm = TRUE)
chicago <- mutate(chicago, pm25.quint = cut(pm25, qq))
```

Now we can group the data frame by the `pm25.quint` variable.

```{r}
quint <- group_by(chicago, pm25.quint)
```

Finally, we can compute the mean of `o3` and `no2` within quintiles of `pm25`.

```{r}
summarize(quint, o3 = mean(o3tmean2, na.rm = TRUE), 
          no2 = mean(no2tmean2, na.rm = TRUE))
```


## `%>%`

The pipeline operater `%>%` is very handy for stringing together multiple `dplyr` functions in a sequence of operations.

```{r,eval=FALSE}
third(second(first(x)))
```

This nesting is not a natural way to think about a sequence of operations. The `%>%` operator allows you to string operations in a left-to-right fashion, i.e.

```{r,eval=FALSE}
first(x) %>% second %>% third
```

## `%>%`
Take the example that we just did in the last section where we computed the mean of `o3` and `no2` within quintiles of `pm25`. There we had to 

1. create a new variable `pm25.quint`
2. split the data frame by that new variable
3. compute the mean of `o3` and `no2` in the sub-groups defined by `pm25.quint`

That can be done with the following sequence in a single R expression.

```{r}
mutate(chicago, pm25.quint = cut(pm25, qq)) %>% 
  group_by(pm25.quint) %>% 
  summarize(o3 = mean(o3tmean2, na.rm = TRUE), no2 = mean(no2tmean2, na.rm = TRUE))
```




## Summary

The `dplyr` package provides a concise set of operations for managing data frames. With these functions we can do a number of complex operations in just a few lines of code. In particular, we can often conduct the beginnings of an exploratory analysis with the powerful combination of `group_by()` and `summarize()`. 

* `dplyr` can work with other data frame "backends" such as SQL databases. There is an SQL interface for relational databases via the DBI package

* `dplyr` can be integrated with the `data.table` package for large fast tables

The `dplyr` package is handy way to both simplify and speed up your data frame management code. It's rare that you get such a combination at the same time!


# Lab Session 1 Cont'd

## `dplyr` 

You'll be working with the `airquality` in the R package `datasets`. Bear in mind `%>%`.

1. Please return all the rows where Temp is larger than 80 and Month is after May.
2. Please  add a new column that displays the temperature in Celsius.
3. Calculate the mean temperature in each month.
4. Remove all the data corresponding to Month = 5, group the data by month, and then find the mean of the temperature each month.
